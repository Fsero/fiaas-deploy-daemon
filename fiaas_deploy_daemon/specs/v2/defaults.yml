admin_access: false # What access the pod has to the k8s api server
has_secrets: false # if true, the application will get secrets as defined in hiearadata on ops1
replicas: 2 # The number of instances to run.
host: # Optional. External hostname to be exposed on. If defined, Ingresses for {host}/{ports.path} is created. See http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/ingress/

ports: # A list of ports the application listens on
  - protocol: http # [http|tcp]
    name: http # A logical name for port discovery. Must be <= 63 characters and match [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? (DNS_LABEL)
    port: 80 # port number that will be exposed. For protocol=tcp, the available port range is (1024-32767).
    target_port: 80 # the port number which is exposed by the container and should receive traffic routed to `port`
    path: / # Only for http. Used together with <host> (see above)
healthchecks:
  liveness:
    # Valid configuration requires exactly one of execute|http|tcp
    execute:
      command: # Command to execute inside the container.

      path: / # Path to GET
      port: http # port to connect to on the container. Must either be port number or name
      http_headers: {} # optional http headers (free form map)
    tcp:
      port: # tcp port number we will connect to on the container. Will receive a SYN and must complete the TCP handshake. Must either be port number or name
